# git-issue
Git extension command for distributed (feature|bug|todo|etc.) tracking within the repository.  Inspired by the now defunct [git-issues](https://github.com/duplys/git-issues) python script.

## Issues Branch
`git-issue` uses `git-issue` to track issues related to its own development.  You are currently looking at the utility branch where issue information is tracked and stored-  swap back over to `master` for a better README and the code.  

Feel free poke around inside of `.issues` to see how the information is stored.
