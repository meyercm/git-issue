## \#5e3c8677: consolidate commit messages

###Status: **Open**
_created by meyer.cm@gmail.com (Chris Meyer) at 2015-09-01 16:06:06 -0400_

currently, commit messages are all over the place- some messages specify the
short-id up front, others not; create events don't seem to be visible, and
creating tags seems to have two different syntaxes.

set "kind" => "todo"
